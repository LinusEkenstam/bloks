						<h1><u>Welcome to Bloks.</u><br /> Less distractions, more writing, give it a try.</h1>
						<h3>I made Bloks, because I needed a place where I could start writing instantly, and that did not focus on articles or social sharing, just me and my thoughts, without any apps or price tags. Just a simple place where I could let my thoughts flow and quickly get saved to my <a href="/db">dropbox.</a> </h3>
						
						<p>All this text is editable, you simply place your marker and start to write, currently I've implemented an easy to use text-format tool, much like the one you see on Medium.com, just mark the text you wish to format, and you'll get options such as: <strong>Bold</strong>, <em>Italic</em>, <u>Marked</u>, <a href="">website links</a>, H1, H2, H3 and big quote. The idea here is to keep notes clean and simple and readably on any device.  </p>
						
						<h2>This is an H2 header</h2>
						<p>Using these types of headers, will let you air up your notes, and make it easier to read your final work. You don't have to use them everywhere, but you can use them in some of your texts location.</p>
						
						<p>Feel free to try the editor out, and please send me any feedback regarding what you like or don't like about the editor, it's for personal use, and I just want to make writing accessible and beautiful. </p>
						
						<h2>By the way “one more thing”</h2>
						<p>This is a prototype, and I'm currently working on a lot of things, I'll try my best to add a project timeline below for you to follow. </p>
